Today I continue my Django journey. I put in an extra hour last night and got up early this morning to continue where I left off. Continuing [the polls Django tutorial][1], I learned about the following things:

* Create views
* Create a URL Conf file to parse and route URLs
* Create models
* Configure a database
* Create database migrations
* Use templates for views
