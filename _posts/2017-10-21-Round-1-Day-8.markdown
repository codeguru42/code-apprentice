Today I continued writing the REST API for BBCT. I followed Test Driven Development (red, green, refactor) as well as I know how. I am happy with the final result. The final result is [17 lines of code for models][1] and [26 lines of code for views][2]. Testing the views required [50 lines of code][3]. I am not completely satisfied with the tests and am considering porting them to pytest which has more powerful features for parametrizing tests.

Beyond massaging the tests, my next tasks are to host this API. I will shop around for cloud services. Amazon AWS and Google Cloud are top contenders here. If anyone has suggestions or recommendations, feel free to contact me on Twitter.
