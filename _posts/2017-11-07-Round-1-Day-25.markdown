I wrote [my first Docker][2] file today following [the example on the official Docker site][1]. However, when I build my container and run it with `docker run -p 4000:8000 bbct-rest` I do not get any output. I found a plugin for IntelliJ that supports Docker. I installed it and configured it to run my container. I get the expected output from my Django app, but I am not sure how to access it in my browser. I mapped port 8000 from the container to port 8000 on my host machine. However, http://localhost:8000 does not give the expected page from my Django project. I need to learn more about how a Docker container interacts with the host machine.
