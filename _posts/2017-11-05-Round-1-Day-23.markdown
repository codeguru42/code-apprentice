I finished [the tutorial to run a Django app on Google App Engine][1] today. It turns out my struggles with Cloud SQL were unecessary to get this to run. The version of the Dajango Polls tutorial used in the GAE tutorial only has a "Hello, World" page. This is only [part 1 of the Django tutorial][2] and does not have the rest of the polls app which uses the database.

Goals for this week:

1. Host my BBCT REST API on GAE.

2. Implement authentication with Google OAuth.

3. Learn if I can use a MySQL database hosted in my Cloud Storage rather than using Cloud SQL. Also learn about the advantages and disadvantages of doing so.
