Tonight, I coded for an hour and a half as well as read a lot of Django documentation. I implemented finished implementing a simple POST handler that inserts a single item to the database. I want to modify this to take an entire list instead. Single items can be inserted by sending a list with one element.

I also started implementing query strings for my GET handler. I learned about Full Text Search, which appears to be supported by many database engines. I don't think I need the full power of this feature yet, but it will be handy when my database becomese more complex. I currently have only four tables each with a single column (other than the primary key). For now I want to send a single query string and return all rows of a table which contain that string in the single column. I will increase the complexity of this as necessary in the future.
