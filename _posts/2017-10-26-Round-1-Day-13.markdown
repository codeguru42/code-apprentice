Yesterday I attempted to implement a `post()` method in my new View class. I learned that `request.POST` can only be used to read form data. In my project, I intend to read JSON data sent as the body of the HTTP request. So far, I have relied on the default serialization to convert my Model subclasses to a JSON string. It looks like I may need to write my own serializers in order to get the behavior I want.
